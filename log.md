# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 25, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on making a website for a multimedia business I'm starting with my wife. Set position:sticky on the sections and made it a bit prettier for mobile.
**Thoughts:** Position:sticky is weird. Spent about an hour trying to figure it out reading MDN documentation and some tutorials from CSS tricks. In the end the reason it wasnt working was because my SASS file wasn't compiling to CSS. Still need to work on the design and the content.
